/*
 * Each RISC-V capability ends up encoded as a single set bit in an array of
 * words. When specifying a new capability, write a new RISCV_DEFINE_CAP
 * statement, with an argument as the extension name in all-caps,
 * second argument as the index in the array where the capability will be stored
 * and third argument as the index of the bit to be used to encode the
 * capability.
