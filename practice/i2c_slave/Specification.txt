SPEC:

The EPS module have the register layout(array) in main.h

Your task is to read temperature and voltage data from the EPS module and give them commands to turn other sub systems on or off.

There are 3 operating states: CRITICAL, IDLE and RUN

CRITICAL: 
	condition: when voltage is < 3V
	action: turn OFF COM and GNC power supply and change EPS to SAVE mode.

IDLE: 
	condition: when voltage is < 5V
	action: change COM and GNC power supply to SAVE mode and keep EPS ON.

RUN:
	condition: when voltage is >= 7V
	action: everything should be ON

Assign each operation state a LED color for it.
We'll not worry about temperature for now, but make sure temperature data transmits correctly.
Make sure to swap between tasks instead of using a simple if else statement
Check the EPS voltage and temperature every 50 ms.
You should have a similar array structure within the CDH module.

Optional, write a i2c timeout handling where if the I2C communication fails within 2 seconds.
